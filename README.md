## GenAI Usage
I consulted Gemini 2.5 Flash for the following questions:
1. "Please provide some suitable font-family recommendations."
2. "Can you provide an example of a Bootstrap card hover effect and explain the parameters?"
3. "How can I use JavaScript to prevent a link from jumping and achieve a smooth scroll effect?"

These consultations helped me implement proper typography, interactive card effects, and smooth scrolling functionality in the homepage.
